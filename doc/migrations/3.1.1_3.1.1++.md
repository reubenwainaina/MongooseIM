## **`odbc` renamed to `rdbms` in module names and options**

* **For MongooseIM users:** simply replace all instances of `odbc` in your config files with `rdbms`.
  E.g. `{auth_method, odbc}.` would now be `{auth_method, rdbms}.`.<br/>
  It's also important to note that all metrics that previously contained `odbc` in their names have also been renamed to contain `rdbms` instead.

  Please note that `odbc_server` has been completely replaced with new `outgoing_pools` (see one of the next sections of this document) config element.

* **For developers calling MongooseIM modules:** most modules, functions and atoms had `odbc` in their names replaced with `rdbms`.
  The only exceptions to this rule were names actually pertaining to the ODBC driver, e.g. `mongoose_rdbms_odbc` or `ejabberd_check:check_database_module(odbc)`.

## **`ejabberd.cfg` renamed to `mongooseim.cfg`**

Rename the existing config file of MongooseIM from `ejabberd.cfg` to `mongooseim.cfg`.

## Pools configuration

Configuring pools to external services has changed, please see [Outgoing Connection doc](../advanced-configuration/outgoing-connections.md) for more details.

NOTE: Keep in mind that `outgoing_pools` is a list of pools, it may turn out that you will have more than one entry in the list when more than a single outgoing pool is needed.

### Example - Old format

```erlang
{elasticsearch_server, [{host, "elastic.host.com"}, {port, 9042}]}.
{riak_server, [{pool_size, 20}, {address, "127.0.0.1"}, {port, 8087}, {riak_pb_socket_opts, []}]}.
{http_connections, [{conn1, [{server, "http://server:8080"}, {pool_size, 50}]} ]}.
{cassandra_servers, [
  {default, 100,
   [
    {servers,
     [
      {"cassandra_server1.example.com", 9042},
      {"cassandra_server2.example.com", 9042},
      {"cassandra_server3.example.com", 9042},
      {"cassandra_server4.example.com", 9042}
     ]
    },
    {keyspace, "big_mongooseim"}
   ]
  }
 ]
}.
```

### Example - New format

This section provides direct "translation" of configuration from "Old format" section.

```erlang
{outgoing_pools, [
  {elastic, global, default, [], [{host, "elastic.host.com"}, {port, 9042}]},
  {riak, global, default, [{workers, 20}], [{address, "127.0.0.1"}, {port, 8087}]},
  {http, global, conn1, [{workers, 50}], [{server, "http://server:8080"}]},
  {cassandra, global, default, [{workers, 100}], [
        {servers, [
          {"cassandra_server1.example.com", 9042},
          {"cassandra_server2.example.com", 9042},
          {"cassandra_server3.example.com", 9042},
          {"cassandra_server4.example.com", 9042}
        ]},
        {keyspace, "big_mongooseim"}
    ]}
]}.
```
